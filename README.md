# RGB-Color-Guessing-Game
Open the HTML file to start playing the game.
The game loads 6 six random colors and it gives your the RGB values of one of them, you then would click the one color that you think corresponds to the values you have.
The project was done alongside with THE WEB Developer BOOTCAMP on Udemy
